_Data validation made beautiful and powerful_

</div>

Pointblank is a powerful, yet elegant data validation framework for Python that transforms how you ensure data quality. With its intuitive, chainable API, you can quickly validate your data against comprehensive quality checks and visualize results through stunning, interactive reports that make data issues immediately actionable.

Whether you're a data scientist, data engineer, or analyst, Pointblank helps you catch data quality issues before they impact your analyses or downstream systems.

## Getting Started in 30 Seconds

```python
import pointblank as pb

validation = (
   pb.Validate(data=pb.load_dataset(dataset="small_table"))
   .col_vals_gt(columns="d", value=100)             # Validate values > 100
   .col_vals_le(columns="c", value=5)               # Validate values <= 5
   .col_exists(columns=["date", "date_time"])       # Check columns exist
   .interrogate()                                   # Execute and collect results
)

# Get the validation report from the REPL with:
validation.get_tabular_report().show()

# From a notebook simply use:
validation
```

## Real-World Example

```python
import pointblank as pb
import polars as pl

# Load your data
sales_data = pl.read_csv("sales_data.csv")

# Create a comprehensive validation
validation = (
   pb.Validate(
      data=sales_data,
      tbl_name="sales_data",           # Name of the table for reporting
      label="Real-world example.",     # Label for the validation, appears in reports
      thresholds=(0.01, 0.02, 0.05),   # Set thresholds for warnings, errors, and critical issues
      actions=pb.Actions(              # Define actions for any threshold exceedance
         critical="Major data quality issue found in step {step} ({time})."
      ),
      final_actions=pb.FinalActions(   # Define final actions for the entire validation
         pb.send_slack_notification(
            webhook_url="https://hooks.slack.com/services/your/webhook/url"
         )
      ),
      brief=True,                      # Add automatically-generated briefs for each step
   )
   .col_vals_between(            # Check numeric ranges with precision
      columns=["price", "quantity"],
      left=0, right=1000
   )
   .col_vals_not_null(           # Ensure that columns ending with '_id' don't have null values
      columns=pb.ends_with("_id")
   )
   .col_vals_regex(              # Validate patterns with regex
      columns="email",
      pattern="^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$"
   )
   .col_vals_in_set(             # Check categorical values
      columns="status",
      set=["pending", "shipped", "delivered", "returned"]
   )
   .conjointly(                  # Combine multiple conditions
      lambda df: pb.expr_col("revenue") == pb.expr_col("price") * pb.expr_col("quantity"),
      lambda df: pb.expr_col("tax") >= pb.expr_col("revenue") * 0.05
   )
   .interrogate()
)
```

```
Major data quality issue found in step 7 (2025-04-16 15:03:04.685612+00:00).

# Get an HTML report you can share with your team

## Installation

You can install Pointblank using pip:

```bash
pip install pointblank
```

You can also install Pointblank from Conda-Forge by using:

```bash
conda install conda-forge::pointblank
```

If you don't have Polars or Pandas installed, you'll need to install one of them to use Pointblank.

```bash
pip install "pointblank[pl]" # Install Pointblank with Polars
pip install "pointblank[pd]" # Install Pointblank with Pandas
```

To use Pointblank with DuckDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite, install Ibis with the appropriate backend:

```bash
pip install "pointblank[duckdb]"   # Install Pointblank with Ibis + DuckDB
pip install "pointblank[mysql]"    # Install Pointblank with Ibis + MySQL
pip install "pointblank[postgres]" # Install Pointblank with Ibis + PostgreSQL
pip install "pointblank[sqlite]"   # Install Pointblank with Ibis + SQLite
```

## Technical Details

Pointblank uses [Narwhals](https://github.com/narwhals-dev/narwhals) to work with Polars and Pandas DataFrames, and integrates with [Ibis](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis) for database and file format support. This architecture provides a consistent API for validating tabular data from various sources.

## Contributing to Pointblank

There are many ways to contribute to the ongoing development of Pointblank. Some contributions can

for information on how to get started.

## Roadmap

We're actively working on enhancing Pointblank with:

1. Additional validation methods for comprehensive data quality checks
2. Advanced logging capabilities
3. Messaging actions (Slack, email) for threshold exceedances
4. LLM-powered validation suggestions and data dictionary generation
5. JSON/YAML configuration for pipeline portability
6. CLI utility for validation from the command line
7. Expanded backend support and certification
8. High-quality documentation and examples

If you have any ideas for features or improvements, don't hesitate to share them with us! We are always looking for ways to make Pointblank better.
