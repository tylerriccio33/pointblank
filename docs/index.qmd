_Find out if your data is what you think it is_

</div>

Pointblank is a table validation and testing library for Python. It helps you ensure that your
tabular data meets certain expectations and constraints and it presents the results in a beautiful
validation report table.

## Getting Started

Let's take a Polars DataFrame and validate it against a set of constraints. We do that by using the
`Validate` class along with adding validation steps:

```python
import pointblank as pb

validation = (
    pb.Validate(data=pb.load_dataset(dataset="small_table")) # Use Validate() to start
    .col_vals_gt(columns="d", value=100)       # STEP 1 |
    .col_vals_le(columns="c", value=5)         # STEP 2 | <-- Building a validation plan
    .col_exists(columns=["date", "date_time"]) # STEP 3 |
    .interrogate() # This will execute all validation steps and collect intel
)

validation
```

<div style="text-align: center;">

![](/assets/pointblank-tabular-report.png){width=100%}

</div>

The rows in the validation report table correspond to each of the validation steps. One of the key
concepts is that validation steps can be broken down into atomic test cases (test units), where each
of these test units is given either of pass/fail status based on the validation constraints. You'll
see these tallied up in the reporting table (in the `UNITS`, `PASS`, and `FAIL` columns).

The tabular reporting view is just one way to see the results. You can also obtain fine-grained
results of the interrogation as individual step reports or via methods that provide key metrics.
It's also possible to use the validation results for downstream processing, such as filtering the
input table based on the pass/fail status of the rows.

On the input side, we can use the following types of tables:

- Polars DataFrame
- Pandas DataFrame
- DuckDB table
- MySQL table
- PostgreSQL table
- SQLite table
- Parquet

To make this all work seamlessly, we use [Narwhals](https://github.com/narwhals-dev/narwhals) to
work with Polars and Pandas DataFrames. We also integrate with
[Ibis](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis) to enable the use of DuckDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite,
Parquet, and more! In doing all of this, we can provide an ergonomic and consistent API for
validating tabular data from various sources.

## Features

Here's a short list of what we think makes Pointblank a great tool for data validation:

- **Flexible**: We support tables from Polars, Pandas, Duckdb, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Parquet
- **Beautiful Reports**: Generate beautiful HTML table reports of your data validation results
- **Functional Output**: Easily pull the specific data validation outputs you need for further processing
- **Easy to Use**: Get started quickly with a straightforward API and clear documentation examples
- **Powerful**: You can make complex data validation rules with flexible options for composition

## Installation

You can install Pointblank using pip:

```bash
pip install pointblank
```
