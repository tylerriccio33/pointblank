Thresholds are a key concept in Pointblank that allow you to define acceptable limits for failing
validation tests. Rather than a simple pass/fail model, thresholds enable you to signal failure at
different severity levels ('warning', 'error', and 'critical'), giving you fine-grained control over
how data quality issues are reported and handled.

When used with actions (covered in the next section), thresholds create a robust system for
responding to data quality issues based on their severity. This approach allows you to:

- set different tolerance levels for different types of validation checks
- escalate responses based on the severity of data quality issues
- configure different notification strategies for different threshold levels
- create a more nuanced data validation workflow than simple pass/fail tests

## A Simple Example

Let's start with a basic example that demonstrates how thresholds work in practice:

```{python}
import pointblank as pb

(
    pb.Validate(data=pb.load_dataset(dataset="small_table", tbl_type="polars"))
    .col_vals_not_null(
        columns="c",

        # Set thresholds for the validation step ---
        thresholds=pb.Thresholds(warning=1, error=0.2)
    )
    .interrogate()
)
```

In this example, we're validating that column `c` contains no Null values. We've set:

- A 'warning' threshold of `1` (triggers when 1 or more values are Null)
- An 'error' threshold of `0.2` (triggers when 20% or more values are Null)

Looking at the results:

- the `FAIL` column shows that 2 test units have failed
- the `W` column (for 'warning') shows a filled gray circle, indicating the warning threshold has
been exceeded
- the `E` column (for 'error') shows an open yellow circle, indicating the error threshold has not
been exceeded
- the `C` column (for 'critical') shows a dash since we didn't set a critical threshold

## Types of Threshold Values

Thresholds in Pointblank can be specified in two different ways:

### Absolute Thresholds

Absolute thresholds are specified as integers and represent a fixed number of failing test units:

```python
# Warning threshold of exactly 5 failing test units
thresholds_absolute = pb.Thresholds(warning=5)
```

With this configuration, the 'warning' threshold would be triggered if 5 or more test units fail.

### Proportional Thresholds

Proportional thresholds are specified as decimals between 0 and 1, representing a percentage of the
total test units:

```python
# Error threshold of 10% of test units failing
thresholds_proportional = pb.Thresholds(error=0.1)
```

With this configuration, the 'error' threshold would be triggered if 10% or more of the test units
fail.

## Understanding Severity Levels

The three threshold levels in Pointblank ('warning', 'error', and 'critical') are inspired by
traditional logging levels used in software development. These names suggest a progression of
severity:

- **'warning'** (level `30`): indicates potential issues that don't necessarily prevent normal
operation
- **'error'** (level `40`): suggests more serious problems that might impact data quality
- **'critical'** (level `50`): represents the most severe issues that likely require immediate
attention

These numerical values (`30`, `40`, `50`) are used internally by Pointblank when determining
threshold hierarchy and can be accessed through the `{level_num}` field in action metadata (covered
in the next **User Guide** article).

While these names imply certain severity levels, they're ultimately just convenient labels for
different thresholds. You have complete flexibility in how you use them:

- you could use 'warning' for issues that should block a pipeline
- you might configure 'critical' for minor issues that just need documentation
- the 'error' level could trigger informational emails rather than actual error handling

The naming is primarily a suggestion to help organize your validation strategy. What matters most is
how you configure actions for each threshold level to suit your specific data quality requirements.

## Threshold Behavior

It's important to understand a few key behaviors of thresholds:

- thresholds are **inclusive**: a value equal to or exceeding the threshold will trigger the
associated level
- thresholds can be **mixed**: you can use absolute values for some levels and proportional for
others
- threshold levels are **hierarchical**: 'critical' is more severe than 'error', which is more
severe than 'warning'
- when a test fails, **all** applicable threshold levels are marked in the report (though actions
may only execute for the highest level by default)

## Setting Global Thresholds

You can set thresholds globally for all validation steps in a workflow using the `thresholds=`
parameter in `Validate`:

```{python}
(
    pb.Validate(
        data=pb.load_dataset(dataset="small_table", tbl_type="polars"),

        # Setting thresholds for all validation steps ---
        thresholds=pb.Thresholds(warning=1, error=0.1)
    )
    .col_vals_not_null(columns="a")
    .col_vals_gt(columns="a", value=2)
    .interrogate()
)
```

With this approach, the same thresholds are applied to every validation step in the workflow.

## Overriding Thresholds for Specific Steps

You can override global thresholds for specific validation steps by providing the `thresholds=`
parameter in individual validation methods:

```{python}
(
    pb.Validate(
        data=pb.load_dataset(dataset="small_table", tbl_type="polars"),

        # Setting global thresholds ---
        thresholds=pb.Thresholds(warning=1, error=0.1)
    )
    .col_vals_not_null(columns="a")
    .col_vals_gt(
        columns="a", value=2,

        # Step-specific threshold that overrides global ---
        thresholds=pb.Thresholds(warning=3)
    )
    .interrogate()
)
```

In this example, the second validation step uses its own 'warning' threshold of `3`, overriding the
global setting of `1`.

## Ways to Define Thresholds

Pointblank offers multiple ways to define thresholds to accommodate different coding styles and
requirements.

### 1. Using the `Thresholds` Class (Recommended)

The most explicit and flexible approach is using the `Thresholds` class:

```{python}
# Set individual thresholds for different levels
thresholds_all_levels = pb.Thresholds(warning=0.05, error=0.1, critical=0.25)

# Set only specific levels
thresholds_error_only = pb.Thresholds(error=0.15)
```

This approach allows you to:

- set any combination of threshold levels
- use descriptive parameter names for clarity
- skip levels you don't need to set

### 2. Using a Tuple

For concise code, you can use a tuple where positions represent 'warning', 'error', and 'critical'
levels in that order:

```{python}
# (warning, error, critical)
thresholds_tuple = (1, 0.1, 0.25)

# Shorter tuples are also allowed
thresholds_tuple_warning = (3,)            # Only the 'warning' threshold
thresholds_tuple_warning_error = (3, 0.2)  # Both 'warning' and 'error' thresholds
```

While concise, this approach requires you to start with the 'warning' level and add levels in order.

### 3. Using a Dictionary

You can also use a dictionary with keys that match the threshold level names:

```{python}
# Can use any combination of threshold levels
thresholds_dict = {"warning": 1, "critical": 0.15}
```

The dictionary must use the exact keys `"warning"`, `"error"`, and/or `"critical"`.

### 4. Using a Single Value

The simplest approach is using a single numeric value, which sets just the 'warning' threshold:

```{python}
# Sets 'warning' threshold to `5`
thresholds_single = 5
```

This is equivalent to `pb.Thresholds(warning=5)`.

## Thresholds and Validation Steps

Let's look at a more complete validation workflow that demonstrates different threshold
configurations:

```{python}
# Create a validation workflow with global and step-specific thresholds
(
    pb.Validate(
        data=pb.load_dataset(dataset="small_table", tbl_type="polars"),

        # Global thresholds applied to all steps unless overridden ---
        thresholds=pb.Thresholds(warning=0.05, error=0.1, critical=0.2)
    )

    # Step 1: Uses global thresholds ---
    .col_vals_not_null(columns="b")

    # Step 2: Overrides with step-specific thresholds ---
    .col_vals_gt(
        columns="a", value=2,
        thresholds=pb.Thresholds(warning=1, critical=0.3) # No 'error' threshold
    )

    # Step 3: Uses a simplified tuple notation ---
    .col_vals_not_null(columns="c", thresholds=(2, 0.15))

    .interrogate()
)
```

## Thresholds and Actions

While thresholds by themselves provide visual indicators of validation severity in reports, their
real power emerges when combined with Actions. The Actions system (covered in the next article)
allows you to specify what happens when a threshold is exceeded.

For example, you might configure:

- A 'warning' threshold that logs a message
- An 'error' threshold that sends an email notification
- A 'critical' threshold that blocks a data pipeline

Here's a simple preview of how thresholds and actions work together:

```{python}
(
    pb.Validate(
        data=pb.load_dataset(dataset="small_table", tbl_type="polars"),

        # Define thresholds for all three severity levels ---
        thresholds=pb.Thresholds(warning=1, error=2, critical=3),

        # Define actions for different threshold levels ---
        actions=pb.Actions(
            warning="Warning: {step} has {FAIL} failing values",
            error="ERROR: Step {step} exceeded the 'error' threshold",
            critical="CRITICAL: Data quality issue in column {col}"
        )
    )
    .col_vals_not_null(columns="c")
    .interrogate()
)
```

## Conclusion

Thresholds are a powerful feature that transform Pointblank from a simple validation tool into a
sophisticated data quality monitoring system. By setting appropriate thresholds, you can:

1. Define different severity levels for data quality issues
2. Customize tolerance levels for different types of validation checks
3. Create a more nuanced approach to data validation than binary pass/fail
4. Enable targeted actions based on the severity of issues detected

In the next article, we'll explore the Actions system in depth, showing you how to define automatic
responses when thresholds are exceeded.
