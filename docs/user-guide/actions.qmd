Actions are meant to be combined with thresholds and they allow you easily write text to the console
or execute custom functions. As an example, when testing a column for values that should always be
greater than `2` you might want some text emitted to the console when any failing test units are
found. To do that, you need to pair a threshold level with an associated action (and that action
could take the form of a console message).

## How Actions Work

Let's look at an example on how this works in practice. The following validation plan contains a
single step (using
[`col_vals_gt()`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/Validate.col_vals_gt.html)) where
the `thresholds=` and `actions=` parameters are set using
[`Thresholds`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/Thresholds.html) and
[`Actions`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/Actions.html) calls:

```{python}
import pointblank as pb

validation_1 = (
    pb.Validate(data=pb.load_dataset(dataset="small_table"))
    .col_vals_gt(
        columns="c",
        value=2,
        thresholds=pb.Thresholds(warning=1, error=5),
        actions=pb.Actions(warning="WARNING: failing test found.")
    )
    .interrogate()
)

validation_1
```

The code uses `thresholds=pb.Thresholds(warning=1, error=5)` to set a 'warning' threshold of `1` and
an 'error' threshold of `5` failing test units. The results part of the validation table shows that:

- The `FAIL` column shows that 3 tests units have failed
- The `W` column (short for 'warning') shows a filled gray circle indicating it's reached its
threshold level
- The `E` ('error') column shows an open yellow circle indicating it's below the threshold
level

More importantly, the text `"WARNING: failing test found."` has been emitted. Here it appears above
the validation table and that's because the action is executed eagerly during interrogation
(before the report has even been generated).

So, an action is executed for a particular condition (e.g., 'warning') within a validation step if
these three things are true:

1. there is a threshold set for that condition (either globally, or as part of that step)
2. there is an associated action set for the condition (again, either set globally or within the
step)
3. during interrogation, the threshold value for the condition was exceeded by the number or
proportion of failing test units

There is a lot of flexibility for setting both thresholds and actions and everything here is
considered optional. Put another way, you can set various thresholds and various actions as needed
and the interrogation phase will determine whether all the requirements are met for executing
an action.

## Expressing Actions with a String

There are a few options in how to define the actions:

1. **String**: a message to be displayed in the console
2. **Callable**: a function to be called
3. **List of Strings/Callables**: for execution of multiple messages or functions

The actions are executed at interrogation time when the threshold level assigned to the action
is exceeded by the number or proportion of failing test units. When providing a string, it will
simply be printed to the console. A callable will also be executed at the time of interrogation.
If providing a list of strings or callables, each item in the list will be executed in order.
Such a list can contain a mix of strings and callables.

Displaying console messages may be a simple approach, but it is effective. And the strings don't
have to be static, there are templating features that can be useful for constructing strings for a
variety of situations. The following placeholders are available for use:

- `{type}`: The validation step type where the action is executed (e.g., ‘col_vals_gt’, etc.)
- `{level}`: The threshold level where the action is executed (‘warning’, ‘error’, or ‘critical’)
- `{step}` or `{i}`: The step number in the validation workflow where the action is executed
- `{col}` or `{column}`: The column name where the action is executed
- `{val}` or `{value}`: An associated value for the validation method
- `{time}`: A datetime value for when the action was executed

Here's an example where we prepare a console message with a number of value placeholders
(`action_str`) and use it globally at `Actions(critical=)`:

```{python}
action_str = "[{LEVEL}: {TYPE}]: Step {step} has failed validation. ({time})"

validation_2 = (
    pb.Validate(
        data=pb.load_dataset(dataset="game_revenue", tbl_type="duckdb"),
        thresholds=pb.Thresholds(warning=0.05, error=0.10, critical=0.15),
        actions=pb.Actions(critical=action_str),
    )
    .col_vals_regex(columns="player_id", pattern=r"[A-Z]{12}\d{3}")
    .col_vals_gt(columns="item_revenue", value=0.10)
    .col_vals_ge(columns="session_duration", value=15)
    .interrogate()
)

validation_2
```

What we get here are two messages in the console, corresponding to critical failures in steps 2 and
3. The placeholders were replaced with the correct text for the context. Note that some of the
resulting text is capitalized (e.g., `"CRITICAL"`, `"COL_VALS_GT"`, etc.) and this is because we
capitalized the placeholder text itself. Have a look at the documentation article of
[`Actions`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/Actions.html) for more details on this.

## Making Actions with Callables

Aside from strings, any callable can be used as an action value. Here's an example where we use a
custom function as part of an action:

```{python}
def duration_issue():
    from datetime import datetime

    print(f"Data quality issue found ({datetime.now()}).")


validation_3 = (
    pb.Validate(
        data=pb.load_dataset(dataset="game_revenue", tbl_type="duckdb"),
        thresholds=pb.Thresholds(warning=0.05, error=0.10, critical=0.15),
    )
    .col_vals_regex(columns="player_id", pattern=r"[A-Z]{12}\d{3}")
    .col_vals_gt(columns="item_revenue", value=0.05)
    .col_vals_gt(
        columns="session_duration",
        value=15,
        actions=pb.Actions(warning=duration_issue),
    )
    .interrogate()
)

validation_3
```

In this case, the 'warning' action is set to call the user's `dq_issue()` function. This action is
only executed when the 'warning' threshold is exceeded in step 3. Because all three thresholds are
exceeded in that step, the 'warning' action of executing the function occurs (resulting in a
message being printed to the console).

This is an example where actions can be defined locally for an individual validation step. The
global threshold setting applied to all three validation steps but the step-level action only
applied to step 3. You are free to mix and match both threshold and action settings at the global
level (i.e., set in the [`Validate`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/Validate.html)
call) or at the step level. The key thing to be aware of is that step-level settings of thresholds
and actions take precedence.
