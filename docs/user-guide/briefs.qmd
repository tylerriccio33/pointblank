```

When validating data with Pointblank, it's often helpful to have descriptive labels for each
validation step. This is where *briefs* come in. A brief is a short description of what a validation
step is checking and it appears in the `STEP` column of the validation report table. Briefs make
your validation reports more readable and they help others understand what each step is verifying
without needing to look at the code.

Briefs can be set in two ways:

1. **Globally**: applied to all validation steps via the `brief=` parameter in
[`Validate()`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/Validate.html)
2. **Locally**: set for individual validation steps via the `brief=` parameter in each validation
method

Understanding these two approaches to adding briefs gives you flexibility in how you document your
validation process. Global briefs provide consistency across all steps and save time when you want
similar descriptions throughout, while step-level briefs allow for precise customization when
specific validations need more detailed or unique explanations. In practice, many validation
workflows will combine both approaches (i.e., setting a useful global brief template while
overriding it for steps that require special attention).

## Global Briefs

To set a global brief that applies to all validation steps, use the `Validate(brief=)` parameter
when creating a `Validate` object:

```{python}
import pointblank as pb
import polars as pl

# Sample data
data = pl.DataFrame({
    "id": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "value": [10, 20, 30, 40, 50],
    "category": ["A", "B", "C", "A", "B"]
})

# Create a validation with a global brief
validation_1 = (
    pb.Validate(
        data=data,
        tbl_name="example_data",
        brief="Step {step}: {auto}"  # Global brief template
    )
    .col_vals_gt(
        columns="value",
        value=5
    )
    .col_vals_in_set(
        columns="category",
        set=["A", "B", "C"]
    )
    .interrogate()
)

validation_1
```

In this example, every validation step will have a brief description that follows the pattern
`"Step X: [auto-generated description]"`.

This is a simple example of template-based briefs. Later in this guide, we'll explore the full range
of templating elements available for creating custom brief descriptions that precisely communicate
what each validation step is checking.

## Step-level Briefs

You can also set briefs for individual validation steps:

```{python}
validation_2 = (
    pb.Validate(data=data, tbl_name="example_data")
    .col_vals_gt(
        columns="value",
        value=5,
        brief="Check if values exceed minimum threshold of 5"
    )
    .col_vals_in_set(
        columns="category",
        set=["A", "B", "C"],
        brief="Verify categories are valid"
    )
    .interrogate()
)

validation_2
```

Local briefs override any global briefs that might be set.

## Brief Templating

Briefs support templating elements that get replaced with specific values:

- `{auto}`: an auto-generated description of the validation
- `{step}`: the step number in the validation plan
- `{col}`: the column name(s) being validated
- `{value}`: the comparison value used in the validation (when applicable)
- `{set}`: the set of values used in set-based validations
- `{operator}`: the logical operator used in the validation (e.g., `>`, `<`, etc.)
- `{threshold}`: the threshold values defined for the validation step (if any)

Here's how to use these templates:

```{python}
validation_3 = (
    pb.Validate(data=data, tbl_name="example_data")
    .col_vals_gt(
        columns="value",
        value=5,
        brief="Step {step}: Checking column '{col}' for values `> 5`"
    )
    .col_vals_in_set(
        columns="category",
        set=["A", "B", "C"],
        brief="{auto} **(Step {step})**"
    )
    .interrogate()
)

validation_3
```

These template elements make briefs highly flexible and customizable. You can combine multiple
templating elements in a single brief to create descriptive yet concise validation step
descriptions. The templates help maintain consistency across your validation reports while providing
enough detail to understand what each step is checking.

Note that not all templating elements will be relevant for every validation step. For instance,
`{set}` is only applicable to validation functions like
[`col_vals_in_set()`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/Validate.col_vals_in_set.html)
that use a set of values, while `{value}` would be used in comparisons like
[`col_vals_gt()`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/Validate.col_vals_gt.html). If
you include a templating element that isn't relevant to a particular step, it will simply be
ignored.

Briefs support the use of Markdown formatting, allowing you to add emphasis with **bold** or
_italic_ text, include `inline code` formatting, or other Markdown elements to make your briefs more
visually distinctive and informative. This can be especially helpful when you want certain parts of
your briefs to stand out in the validation report.

## Automatic Briefs

If you want Pointblank to generate briefs for you automatically, you can set `brief=True`. Here,
we'll make that setting at the global level (by using `Validate(brief=True)`):

```{python}
validation_4 = (
    pb.Validate(
        data=data,
        tbl_name="example_data",
        brief=True
    )
    .col_vals_gt(
        columns="value",
        value=5
    )
    .col_vals_in_set(
        columns="category",
        set=["A", "B", "C"]
    )
    .interrogate()
)

validation_4
```

Automatic briefs are descriptive and include information about what's being validated, including the
column names and the validation conditions.

## Briefs Localized to a Specified Language

When using the `lang=` parameter in `Validate()`, automatically generated briefs will be created in
the specified language (along with other elements of the validation report table):

```{python}
validation_5 = (
    pb.Validate(
        data=data,
        tbl_name="example_data",
        lang="es",  # Spanish
        brief=True  # Auto-generate all briefs in Spanish
    )
    .col_vals_gt(
        columns="value",
        value=5
    )
    .col_vals_in_set(
        columns="category",
        set=["A", "B", "C"]
    )
    .interrogate()
)

validation_5
```

When using the `lang=` parameter in combination with the `{auto}` templating element, the
auto-generated portion of the brief will also be translated to the specified language. This makes it
possible to create fully localized validation reports where both custom text and auto-generated
descriptions appear in the same language.

Pointblank supports several languages for localized briefs, including French (`"fr"`), German
(`"de"`), Spanish (`"es"`), Italian (`"it"`), and Portuguese (`"pt"`). For the complete list of
supported languages, refer to the
[`Validate()`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/Validate.html) documentation.

## Disabling Briefs

If you've set a global brief but want to disable it for specific validation steps, you can set
`brief=False`:

```{python}
validation_6 = (
    pb.Validate(
        data=data,
        tbl_name="example_data",
        brief="Step {step}: {auto}"  # Global brief template
    )
    .col_vals_gt(columns="value", value=5)  # Uses global brief
    .col_vals_in_set(
        columns="category",
        set=["A", "B", "C"],
        brief=False  # No brief for this step
    )
    .interrogate()
)

validation_6
```

## Best Practices for Using Briefs

Well-crafted briefs can significantly enhance the readability and usefulness of your validation
reports. Here are some guidelines to follow:

1. **Be concise**: briefs should be short and to the point; they're meant to quickly communicate the
purpose of a validation step

2. **Be specific**: include relevant details or conditions that make the validation meaningful

3. **Use templates consistently**: if you're using template elements like `"{step}"` or `"{col}"`,
try to use them consistently across all briefs for a cleaner look

4. **Use auto-generated briefs as a starting point**: you can start with `Validate(brief=True)` to
see what Pointblank generates automatically, then customize as needed

5. **Add custom briefs for complex validations**: custom briefs are especially useful for complex
validations where the purpose might not be immediately obvious from the code

Following these best practices will help ensure your validation reports are easy to understand for
everyone who needs to review them.

## Example: Comprehensive Validation with Briefs

In real-world data validation scenarios, you'll likely work with more complex datasets and apply
various types of validation checks. This final example brings together many of the brief-generating
techniques we've covered, showing how you can mix different approaches in a single validation
workflow.

The example below demonstrates:

- custom text briefs with direct messages
- template-based briefs with Markdown formatting
- automatically generated briefs

By combining these different brief styles, you can create validation reports that are informative,
consistent, and tailored to your specific data quality requirements.

```{python}
# Create a more complex dataset
complex_data = pl.DataFrame({
    "id": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],
    "value": [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80],
    "ratio": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8],
    "category": ["A", "B", "C", "A", "B", "C", "A", "B"],
    "date": ["2023-01-01", "2023-01-02", "2023-01-03", "2023-01-04",
             "2023-01-05", "2023-01-06", "2023-01-07", "2023-01-08"]
})

# Create a comprehensive validation
validation_7 = (
    pb.Validate(
        data=complex_data,
        tbl_name="complex_data",
        label="Complex Data Validation"
    )
    .col_vals_gt(
        columns="value",
        value=0,
        brief="All values must be positive."
    )
    .col_vals_between(
        columns="ratio",
        left=0,
        right=1,
        brief="**Step {step}**: Ratios should be between `0` and `1`."
    )
    .col_vals_in_set(
        columns="category",
        set=["A", "B", "C"],
        brief=True  # Auto-generate brief
    )
    .interrogate()
)

validation_7
```

## Conclusion

Briefs help make validation reports more readable and understandable. By using global briefs,
step-level briefs, or a combination of both, you can create validation reports that clearly
communicate what each validation step is checking.

Whether you want automatically generated descriptions or precisely tailored custom messages, the
brief system provides the flexibility to make your data validation work more transparent and easier
to interpret for all stakeholders.
