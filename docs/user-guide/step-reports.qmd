While validation reports provide a comprehensive overview of all validation steps, sometimes you
need to focus on a specific validation step in greater detail. This is where *step reports* come in.
A step report is a detailed examination of a single validation step, providing in-depth information
about the test units that were validated and their pass/fail status.

Step reports are especially useful when debugging validation failures, investigating problematic
data, or communicating detailed findings to colleagues who are responsible for specific data quality
issues.

## Creating a Step Report

To create a step report, you first need to run a validation and then use the
[`get_step_report()`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/Validate.get_step_report.html)
method, specifying which validation step you want to examine:

```{python}
import pointblank as pb
import polars as pl

# Sample data as a Polars DataFrame
data = pl.DataFrame({
    "id": range(1, 11),
    "value": [10, 20, 3, 35, 50, 2, 70, 8, 20, 4],
    "category": ["A", "B", "C", "A", "D", "F", "A", "E", "H", "G"],
    "ratio": [0.5, 0.7, 0.3, 1.2, 0.8, 0.9, 0.4, 1.5, 0.6, 0.2],
    "status": ["active", "active", "inactive", "active", "inactive",
               "active", "inactive", "active", "active", "inactive"]
})

# Create a validation
validation = (
    pb.Validate(data=data, tbl_name="example_data")
    .col_vals_gt(
        columns="value",
        value=10
    )
    .col_vals_in_set(
        columns="category",
        set=["A", "B", "C"]
    )
    .interrogate()
)

# Get step report for the second validation step (i=2)
step_report = validation.get_step_report(i=2)

step_report
```

In this example, we first create and interrogate a validation object with two steps. We then
generate a step report for the second validation step (`i=2`), which checks if the values in the
`category` column are in the set `["A", "B", "C"]`.

## Understanding Step Report Components

A step report consists of several key components that provide detailed information about the
validation step:

1. **Header**: displays the validation step number, type of validation, and a brief description
2. **Table Body**: presents either the failing rows, a sample of completely passing data, or an
expected/actual comparison (for a
[`col_schema_match()`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/Validate.col_schema_match.html)
step)

The step report table highlights passing and failing rows, making it easy to identify problematic
data points. This is especially useful for diagnosing issues when dealing with large datasets.

## Different Types of Step Reports

It's important to note that step reports vary in appearance and structure depending on the type of
validation method used:

- **Value-based validations** (like
[`col_vals_gt()`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/Validate.col_vals_gt.html),
[`col_vals_in_set()`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/Validate.col_vals_in_set.html)):
show individual rows that failed validation
- **Uniqueness checks** ([`rows_distinct()`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/Validate.rows_distinct.html)):
group together the duplicate records in order of appearance
- **Schema validations** ([`col_schema_match()`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/Validate.col_schema_match.html)):
display column-level information about expected vs. actual data types

Additionally, step reports for value-based validations and uniqueness checks operate in two distinct
modes:

1. **When errors are present**: The report shows only the failing rows and, for value-based
validations, clearly highlights the column under study
2. **When no errors exist**: The report header clearly indicates success, and a sample of the data
is shown (along with the studied column highlighted, for value-based validations)

This variation in reporting style allows step reports to effectively communicate the specific type
of validation being performed and display relevant information in the most appropriate format. When
you're working with different validation types, expect to see different step report layouts
optimized for each context.

## Getting Reports for Specific Validation Steps

You can get a step report for any validation step by specifying its step number in the
[`get_step_report()`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/Validate.get_step_report.html)
method:

```{python}
validation.get_step_report(i=1)
```

Note that step numbers in Pointblank start at `1`, matching what you see in the validation report's
`STEP` column (i.e., not 0-based indexing). So the first step is referred to with `i=1`, the second
step with `i=2`, and so on.

## Customizing Step Reports

Step reports can be customized with several parameters to better focus your analysis and tailor the
output to your specific needs. The
[`get_step_report()`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/Validate.get_step_report.html)
method offers multiple customization options to help you create more effective reports.

When a dataset has many columns, you might want to focus on just those relevant to your analysis.
You can create a step report containing only a subset of the columns in the target table:

```{python}
validation.get_step_report(
    i=2,
    columns_subset=["id", "category", "status"]  # Only show these columns
)
```

This approach makes step reports much easier to interpret by highlighting just the essential columns
that help understand the validation failures.

For large datasets with many failing rows, you might want to use `limit=` to set a cap on the number
of rows shown in the report:

```{python}
validation.get_step_report(
    i=2,
    limit=2  # Only show up to 2 failing rows
)
```

The report header can also be extensively customized to provide more specific context. You can
replace the default header with plain text or Markdown formatting:

```{python}
validation.get_step_report(
    i=2,
    header="Category Values Validation: *Critical Analysis*"
)
```

For more advanced header customization, you can use the templating system with the `{title}` and
`{details}` elements to retain parts of the default header while adding your own content. The
`{title}` template is the default title whereas `{details}` provides information on the assertion,
number of failures, etc. Let's move away from the default template of `{title}{details}` and provide
a custom title to go with the details text:

```{python}
validation.get_step_report(
    i=2,
    header="Custom Category Validation Report {details}"
)
```

We can keep `{title}` and `{details}` and add some more context in between the two:

```{python}
validation.get_step_report(
    i=2,
    header=(
        "{title}<br>"
        "<span style='font-size: 0.75em;'>"
        "This validation is critical for our data quality standards."
        "</span><br>"
        "{details}"
    )
)
```

You could always use more HTML and CSS to do *a lot* of customization:

```{python}
validation.get_step_report(
    i=2,
    header=(
        "VALIDATION SUMMARY\n\n{details}\n\n"
        "<hr style='color: lightblue;'>"
        "<div style='font-size: smaller; padding-bottom: 5px; text-transform: uppercase'>"
        "{title}"
        "</div>"
    )
)
```

If you prefer no header at all, simply set `header=None`:

```{python}
validation.get_step_report(
    i=2,
    header=None
)
```

These customization options can be combined to create highly focused reports tailored to specific
needs:

```{python}
validation.get_step_report(
    i=2,
    columns_subset=["id", "category"],
    header="*Category Validation:* Top Issues",
    limit=2
)
```

Through these customization options, you can craft step reports that effectively communicate the
most important information to different audiences. Technical teams might benefit from seeing all
columns but with a limited number of examples. Business stakeholders might prefer a focused view
with only the most relevant columns. For documentation purposes, custom headers provide important
context about what's being validated.

Remember that customizing your step reports is about more than aesthetics: it's about making complex
validation information more accessible and actionable for all stakeholders involved in data quality.

## Using Step Reports for Data Investigation

Step reports can be powerful tools for investigating data quality issues. Let's look at a more
complex example:

```{python}
# Create a more complex dataset with multiple issues
complex_data = pl.DataFrame({
    "id": range(1, 11),
    "value": [10, 20, 3, 40, 50, 2, 70, 80, 90, 7],
    "ratio": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 1.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 1.2, 0.9],
    "category": ["A", "B", "C", "A", "D", "B", "A", "C", "B", "E"]
})

# Create a validation with multiple steps
validation_complex = (
    pb.Validate(data=complex_data, tbl_name="complex_data")
    .col_vals_gt(columns="value", value=10)
    .col_vals_le(columns="ratio", value=1.0)
    .col_vals_in_set(columns="category", set=["A", "B", "C"])
    .interrogate()
)

# Get step report for the ratio validation (step 2)
ratio_report = validation_complex.get_step_report(i=2)

ratio_report
```

In this example, we're investigating issues with the `ratio` column by generating a step report
specifically for that validation step. The step report shows exactly which rows have values that
exceed our maximum threshold of `1.0`.

## Combining Step Reports with Extracts

For more advanced analysis, you can extract the actual data from a step report into a DataFrame:

```{python}
# Extract the data from the step report
failing_ratios = validation_complex.get_data_extracts(i=2)

failing_ratios
```

This extracts the failing rows from the validation step, which you can then further analyze or fix
as needed. Note that the parameter `i=2` corresponds directly to the step number shown in the
validation report; it's the same numbering system used for
[`get_step_report()`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/Validate.get_step_report.html).

These extracts are particularly valuable for analysts who need to:

- perform additional calculations on problematic data
- feed failing records into correction pipelines
- create visualizations of data patterns that led to validation failures
- export problem records to share with data owners

It's worth noting that the validation report itself includes export buttons on the far right of each
row that allow you to download CSV files of the failing data directly. This serves as a convenient
delivery mechanism for sharing extracts with colleagues who may not be working in Python, making the
validation report not just a visual tool but also a practical means of distributing problematic data
for further investigation.

## Step Reports with Segmented Data

When working with segmented validation, step reports become even more valuable as they allow you to
investigate issues within specific segments:

```{python}
# Create data with different regions
segmented_data = pl.DataFrame({
    "id": range(1, 10),
    "value": [10, 20, 3, 40, 50, 2, 6, 8, 60],
    "region": ["North", "North", "South", "South", "East", "East", "West", "West", "West"]
})

# Create a validation with segments
segmented_validation = (
    pb.Validate(data=segmented_data, tbl_name="regional_data")
    .col_vals_gt(
        columns="value",
        value=10,
        segments="region"  # Segment by region
    )
    .interrogate()
)

# Get step report for a specific segment (the 'West' region)
# For segmented validations, each segment gets its own step number
north_report = segmented_validation.get_step_report(i=4)

north_report
```

For segmented validations, each segment is treated as a separate validation step with its own step
number. This allows you to investigate issues specific to each data segment using the appropriate
step number from the validation report.

## Best Practices for Using Step Reports

Here are some guidelines for effectively using step reports in your data validation workflow:

1. **Generate step reports selectively**: create reports only for steps that require detailed
investigation rather than for all steps

2. **Use the `limit=` parameter for large datasets**: when working with large datasets, focus only
on a subset of failing rows to avoid information overload

3. **Share specific step reports with stakeholders**: when collaborating with domain experts, share
relevant step reports to help them understand and address specific data quality issues (and
customize the header to improve clarity)

4. **Combine with extracts for deeper analysis**: use the
[`get_data_extracts()`](https://posit-dev.github.io/pointblank/reference/Validate.get_data_extracts.html)
method to extract the failing rows for further analysis or correction

5. **Document findings from step reports**: when you discover patterns or insights from step
reports, document them to inform future data quality improvements

Remember that step reports are most valuable when used strategically as part of a broader data
quality framework. By following these best practices, you can use step reports not just for
troubleshooting, but to develop a deeper understanding of your data's characteristics and quality
patterns over time. This approach transforms step reports from simple debugging tools into strategic
assets for continuous data quality improvement.

## Conclusion

Step reports provide a focused lens into specific validation steps, allowing you to investigate data
quality issues in detail. By generating targeted reports for specific validation steps, you can:

- pinpoint exactly which data points are causing validation failures
- communicate specific issues to relevant stakeholders
- gather insights that might be missed in the aggregate validation report
- track improvements in specific aspects of data quality over time

Whether you're debugging validation failures, investigating edge cases, or communicating specific
data quality issues to colleagues, step reports can give you the detailed information you need to
understand and resolve data quality problems effectively.
